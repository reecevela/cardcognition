These are just some notes for my personal use for things that go wrong frequently.
If anyone else forks this, feel free to add your own notes.

Docker issues:
1. Do the shell scripts have execute permissions? (chmod +x {filename}.sh)

Database issues:
1. Did you dos2unix the db.dump file? ON THE SERVER AS WELL AS LOCALLY
1.1 Does the db.dump from git pull have the dos2unix applied to it? 
    - Added line in load_db script to take care of this with each docker-compose up
2. Did you docker-compose down, or docker-compose down -v?

Flask issues:
1. Is the virtual environment set up correctly? (source env/bin/activate or .\env\Scripts\activate)
2. Did you pip install -r the requirements.txt file?
