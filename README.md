## Introduction:

Cardcognition is an ongoing project that aims to provide insights into the world of Magic: The Gathering (MTG) with a focus on the Commander format. The tool scrapes card data from popular MTG websites such as EDHREC and analyzes this data to gain insights into card synergies, deck compositions, and card performance in various decks. 

Though still a work in progress, Cardcognition has the potential to become an invaluable resource for both casual and competitive MTG players looking to optimize their Commander decks and enhance their understanding of the game.

## Features:

1. Automated data collection: Cardcognition uses web scraping techniques to gather card data from various MTG websites, ensuring the most up-to-date information is utilized for analysis.
   
2. In-depth card analysis: By calculating synergy scores, inclusion rates, and base inclusion rates for each card, Cardcognition provides insights into how well cards perform in specific decks and with particular Commanders.

3. Database integration: Cardcognition leverages PostgreSQL to store and manage the scraped data, allowing for efficient querying and retrieval of information when needed.

## Future improvements and potential features:

1. Improved data accuracy: As the project progresses, additional data cleaning and processing techniques will be implemented to ensure the highest level of data accuracy.

2. User interface: In the future, Cardcognition could feature an intuitive and user-friendly web interface, allowing users to easily access card data and perform custom analyses.

3. Additional data sources: Cardcognition may integrate data from other MTG websites and sources to provide even more comprehensive insights.

4. Deck-building assistance: Cardcognition could potentially offer deck-building suggestions and recommendations based on user preferences and specific Commander strategies.
